It's a tricky thing, reading a "novel in verse" in translation. 

While the actual narrative asks a bunch of interesting questions, the story
feels rather shallow and unmotivated: Hopeless dandy rejects a girl, kills his
friend in a duel, completely unravels, only to fall desperately in love years
later with the self-same girl he rejected in a past life, only to be rejected in
his own turn.

It's hard _not_ to consider the story as a vehicle for exploring ideas, for 
using the poetry (it _is_ a novel in _verse_, after all) to layer on any
additional meaning and depth that the narrative is lacking, the way Shakespeare
did with Romeo and Juliet.

And so we come to the tricky thing with reading a novel in verse in translation.
While I generally liked the translation by Stanley Mitchell, it's hard to know
whether you're reading Pushkin or Mitchell. In a novel where the verse is so
eminently important, it's a shame to have that verse be closed off by a wall of
translation. Whether or not Mitchel actually does Pushkin justice, in capturing
the nuances, the rhythms, the imagery, is something I won't know until I learn 
Russian. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed Mitchell's poetry, his rhyme and
rhythm.

Writing a narrative in meter, you can't help but put yourself in direct
conversation with the entire history of epic poetry, from Homer to Virgil and 
Dante. It got plenty of smiles, then, at the way Pushkin leans into this,
treating his "epic" of the quintessential superfluous man in the same vein as
Homer. 

Opening the book with a dedication to his Muse, addressing the reader as he
prepares to recount his story, consistently referring to Eugene as "our Hero":
all of this makes the contrast all the more poignant between the wanderings of
ennui-ridden protagonist and the wanderings of the likes of Odysseus and Aeneas.
In this way, it's hard not to compare the novel to a similar experiment in James
Joyce's Ulysses.
