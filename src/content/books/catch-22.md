Had a hard time getting into the story, the characters, and the prose. The absurdism at first came as quite a turn-off, and frankly, while obviously crucial to style and philosophy of the story, continued to leave a bitter taste. The further along you get, the more the fragmented storyline begins to tie together and becomes a compelling tragic story. I suppose I'd need to give it a second read to get all the plays, twists and references.
