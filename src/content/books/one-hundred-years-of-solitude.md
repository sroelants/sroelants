Solid read. Marquez has a knack for creating the loveliest imagery through his words. The constant blend of realism with fantasy makes one feel as if they're reading one long fairy-tale. Make sure to read it in one pull, because the amount of characters and their lives do tend to get cumbersome the farther you get.
