Very mixed feelings about this. Came recommended by several friends whose
opinions I hold in pretty high esteem, but I couldn't help but feel this was as
cheap and poorly-motivated as a Dan Brown novel, while feeling particularly
unimaginative as far as Sci-Fi goes.

I understand that the author is trying to draw delibirate parallels between 
human civilazation and "Trisolaran" civilization [^1]), but to have your alien
civilization sleep _and dream_, of all things, just feels absurd. What are the
odds that a life-form that developed _in an entirely different system_ developed
a biological mechanism as specific as _dreaming_?

The way random physics and computer science tidbits are shoehorned into the
story also feels awkward, at best. A little reminiscent of what Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance tried to do for Philosophy, which felt equally
contrived. I think I'm just not big on novels that try to be pseudo-educational
on the side. I'd rather have my novels be thought-provoking by virtue of it's
narrative, rather than having bits of textbook exposition sprinkled throughout
the story.

I'll probably try reading the other books in the trilogy, hoping that things
will get a little more interesting, but for the time being, I remain somewhat
ambivalent.

[^1]: A name that bugs me to no end, because Sol is a specific star, people, not 
just _any_ star. But I'm willing to put that down on the translation.
