Would love to spend some more time thinking about this, and writing down my 
thoughts

- Unifying model of _many_ defects in current-day society I've noticed.
- Interesting to look at through different lenses (Plato's Republic, rulers must
  be disincentivized and disinterested)
- Allows for a pseudo-physical description in terms of correlations and
  phase-transitions. What does a phase-transition correspond to in this picture,
  exactly?
