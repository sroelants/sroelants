Want to talk about two different approaches to connecting with other people
over the internet, the current social media platform approach, and a more 
indie-web approach.

Go over the merits and pain points of each, and relate it to the expression 
problem in computer science: What are we optimizing for? Easy to add a new
"service"/"interest", or easy to add a new "friend" to follow?

Given that it's really hard for a single user to do an excellent job at
publishing their photos, GPS tracks, reading updates, etc..., what are options
so people can still run their own website, but still have high-quality content?

Some kind of plug and play widgets that people can add to their website? That 
seems unlikely and hardly any better. Feels like going back to a kind of
WordPress universe...
