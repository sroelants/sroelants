                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p> Fryderyk François Chopin (1810 –1849) is one of the most famous, influential, and admired composers and virtuoso pianists of the Romantic era.
                    </p>
                    <p> He was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin, of Polish and French parentage, on 1st March 1810 in the village of Żelazowa Wola, Poland. In Warsaw he was hailed as a child prodigy and as the "second Mozart" for his piano and composition
                        skill, for which the composer Robert Schumann complimented the talented pianist: "Hats off, gentlemen, a genius!" Due to the political situation in Poland, he left his country for France at the age of twenty. There he composed
                        his two piano concertos with their patriotic Polish themes and rhythms, based on traditional Polish dances. He never returned to Poland, but after his death his sister Ludwika took his heart to Poland - in accordance with his last
                        will, where it was placed inside a pillar of the Holy Cross Church at Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street. </p>
                    <p> In Paris, he made a career as a performer and teacher as well as a composer, and he adopted the French variant of his name, "Frédéric-François". In 1836 he met the French writer George Sand, with whom he had a relationship for nine
                        years until 1847. He suffered poor health for much of his life and this forced him to give up performing and teaching shortly before he died on 17th October 1849. </p>

                    <p>His compositions, which are almost exclusively for the piano, such as the Funeral March piano sonata and the twenty-seven études (op. 10 and op. 25, plus a further set of three without opus numbers), are widely considered to be amongst
                        the pinnacles of the piano repertoire. Although some of his music is among the most technically demanding for the instrument, Chopin's style emphasises poetry, nuance, and expressive depth, rather than mere technical display. He
                        is often cited as one of the mainstays of Romanticism in nineteenth-century classical music. </p>

                            <p>
                                The Chopin nocturnes constitute 21 pieces for solo piano written by Frédéric Chopin between 1827 and 1846. They are generally considered among the finest short solo works for the instrument and hold an important place in contemporary concert repertoire.
                                Although Chopin did not invent the nocturne, he popularized and expanded on it, building on the form developed by Irish composer John Field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chopin's nocturnes numbered 1 to 18 were published during his lifetime, in twos or threes, in the order of composition. However, numbers 19 and 20 were actually written first, prior to Chopin's departure from Poland, but published posthumously. Number
                                20 was not originally entitled "nocturne" at all, but since its publication in 1870 as such, it is generally included with publications and recordings of the set.

                    <h2>The Ballades</h2>
                    <p>
                        Frédéric Chopin's four ballades are one-movement pieces for solo piano, composed between 1831 and 1842. They are some of the most challenging pieces in the standard piano repertoire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term ballade was used by Chopin in the sense of a balletic interlude or dance-piece, equivalent to the old Italian ballata, but the term may also have connotations of the medieval heroic ballad, a narrative minstrel-song, often of a fantastical character.
                        There are dramatic and dance-like elements in Chopin's use of the genre, and he may be said to be a pioneer of the ballade as an abstract musical form. The four ballades are said to have been inspired by poet Adam Mickiewicz. The
                        exact inspiration for each individual ballade, however, is unclear and disputed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ballades are considered an innovation of Chopin's and cannot be placed into another form (e.g. sonata). Though they do not conform exactly to sonata form, the "ballade form" created by Chopin for his four ballades is a distinct variant of sonata form
                        with specific discrepancies, such as the mirror reprise (presenting the two expositional themes in reverse order during the recapitulation). The ballades have directly influenced composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms
                        who, after Chopin, wrote ballades of their own.
