      <h1>Why Sorted?</h1>
      <p>
        Sorting algorithms are both the basis as well as the bread and butter of
        algorithm design. They are the first class of algorithms any computer
        science student studies. Because most basic sorting algorithms have a
        fairly straightforward implementation, they are perfect for getting used
        to reasoning about time and space complexity. Also, countless more
        complicated problems have solutions that depend, at their core, on
        whether or not we can sort something. And, as a consequence, their
        complexity will be bounded from below by how efficiently we can sort a
        list of numbers. Deeply understanding these sorting algorithms, then, is
        a crucial step in learning to reason about complexity and more
        sophisticated problems.

        But it can be hard, especially at first, to translate these abstract
        recipes into something tangible. <em>Sorted</em> lets you play with
        different sorting algorithms to see how they perform on different sizes
        of arrays.
