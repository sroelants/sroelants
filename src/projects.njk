<h1> Projects </h1>
<p>A list of fun things I've gotten up to recently.</p>

    <p>
      A simple sorting algorithm visualization. Because, sorting algorithms.
      This was mostly a little plaything to see how React and Typescript play 
      together. (Not too badly, it seems.)

    <ul class="project__list">
      <li><strong>Things I used:</strong> React, Typescript, ES6</li>
      <li><strong>Things I learned:</strong> Using javascript generators to their
      full potential, nesting them recursively. I wrote a post about it 
      <a href="http://samroelants.com/blog/recursive-generators-in-javascript/">here</a>.</li>

    <p>
      An educational game I made when I was diving deeper into the intricacies
      of javascript's <code>this</code> keyword. I made up a whole bunch of
      code examples illustrating different scenarios.

  <h2 class="project__title">clojure-fancify-symbols.vim</h2>
  <div class="project__description">
    <p>
      Spacemacs' Clojure layer comes with a configuration flag <code>
      clojure-enable-fancify-symbols</code> that did a couple of simple 
      (non-destructive) unicode transformations. I wrote a vim plugin to mimic
      the same behavior. (Sorry spacemacs, it just wasn't meant to be...)
    </p>
    <ul class="project__list">
      <li><strong>Things I used:</strong> vimscript</li>
      <li><strong>Things I learned:</strong> How modern vim plugins are structured,
      how awful vimscript is as a language.</li>

  <h2 class="project__title">Tic tac toe in Purescript</h2>
    <div class="project__image">
      <img src="/assets/img/projects/tictactoe.png" />
      </div>
  <div class="project__description">
    <p>
      Wrote a simple tic tac toe game in Purescript, using Pux as a React 
      wrapper. This essentially turns React into an Elm-like MVC architecture, 
      but with an (arguably) better language. I also enjoyed diving into simple
      game AI to wire up the computer player.
    </p>
    <ul class="project__list">
      <li><strong>Things I used:</strong> Purescript, Pux (React)</li>
      <li><strong>Things I learned:</strong> Purescript tooling is not quite 
      there yet, but the language lets you write for the frontend in a language
      that comes close to Haskell's expressivity. Learned about game trees,
      minimax algorithms and alpha-beta pruning.</li>
