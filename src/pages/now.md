## Mood
I've just got back from a couple of weeks in Belgium, seeing family and friends
and getting some paperwork sorted. Other than that, I'm still struggling finding
a balance between work and my personal time, often working far more than
I should because I feel like I have to match other people's productivity.
Working on it...

## Currently playing
I've not invested as much time as I'd like in playing the piano lately..
A couple of weeks ago, I got into a practice rhythm again, and am working
through Bartok's mikrokosmos again. Slow and steady...

## Listening to
Been really hooked on Verdi's (loose) interpretation of Shakespeare's Othello.

Those first 6 minutes are the most outrageous depiction of a naval battre amidst
a raging storm. Cheap thrills? Maybe, but man, is it well excecuted.

## Currently reading
A bunch of scattered things. 
- Started reading/studying Shakespeare's Othello 
after getting hooked on Verdi.
- Still working my way through Tanenbaum's [Computer Networks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10207452-computer-networks), TCP/IP and UDP.
- Finally had the heart to commit to [The Brothers Karamazov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=AOzDLeV6qS&rank=1).
## Currently watching
Just finished watching the excellent [lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aHkqB2-46k) on Cryptography from the
RUB. Well worth a watch (albeit maybe at 1.5 playback speed) if you want to know
the mechanics behind HTTPS, SSH and all the other secure protocols. 
The course goes over stream ciphers, block ciphers, symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography, digital signing, and treats all the major players you'll see
when you click the little padlock in your browser url bar or generate a new SSH
key.

## Poem of the week
Came across a copy of Marianne Moore's [No Swan So Fine](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=19821)
that I'd scribbled down somewhere ages ago, and _man_ is it good.
