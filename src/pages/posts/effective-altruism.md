optimization."

So, there's this thing called _"effective altruism"_ that's been gaining steam
for the last decade or so, in large part thanks to Peter Singer's best-selling
book, _The Life You Can Save_. The basic idea is that, instead of blindly donating
money to whichever charity is the first one that comes to mind, one ought to
first investigate more thoroughly what charity will be able to leverage your
donation to effect the most significant change. Very often, this will not
coincide with the bigger non-profit organizations, since their size comes with
a significant organizational overhead and inertia.

Sounds pretty good so far, right? Why would you ever _not_ donate to the charity
that will get you the best _bang for your buck_? It's an appealing idea, and
I was a pretty strong proponent when I first came to know of it. It carries
a lot of weight with the [Rationalist community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LessWrong) (Rationalism here not
referring to the epistemological position). I feel like it stems from an
increasingly prevalent tendency to _optimize_ and _quantify_ every single
problem that comes our way. One big [Hammer of Rationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(sociology)) for
every nail.

Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily _disagree_ with this idea. I _do_ think,
in the vast majority of cases, it's probably a good idea donating to an
organization which you know will be able to put that money to the best use.
In fact, the [company I work for](https://www.kumu.io), is firmly rooted in this
space of helping organizations, a large portion of which are humanitarian 
non-profits, more effectively tackle the complex problems they face.

The thing that rubs me the wrong way about this approach is not so much tied to
effective altruism _per se_, as much as it is this modern, global, tendency to
_optimize_, _rationalize_ and _quantify_. We just want to "_science the shit out
of this_", as Mark Watney put it so eloquently in The Martian.

I suppose, rather than _denying_ that we should be quantifying as much as we
possibly can, and act on those quantitative assessments, I want to keep the
notion on the table that _some things cannot be quantified, and that's fine_.

I recently read a convincing argument on someone's personal webpage
(unfortunatley, I can't seem to find the link. Will put it here if I come across
it again) that, as privileged, highly educated Westerners, our efforts are
better spent focusing on earning more money, which comes relatively easy, and
donating this to a charity, rather than acting in a more direct, personal
manner.

That sounds great in theory, but the question on my mind is this:

Say I were to do the "most effective thing" and donate to a charity that keeps
refugees off the streets and provides them shelter, which might be able to help
a significant amount more people thanks to my donations. How does that stack up
against my directly interacting with said refugees in the streets, perhaps
letting them know that people actually care about them, rather than have them
feel alone and isolated in a country full of people who don't seem to care about
their fate, save a couple of humanitarian non-profits?

There is such a large _human_ aspect to altruism that, I feel, gets optimized 
away when we try to reduce the simple act of helping others to a math problem.

Deep down, it feels like a cover we made up so we can tell ourselves we'll be
able to fix the world's problems the way we do best: by _consuming_ more. The
commodities we're consuming being the charities we pay so we can get over our
white guilt, but without having to actually go out and confront any of the
issues we helped create.

And, as ever-concious consumers, we like to do our research, and look for the
most interesting deal out there. After all, _don't we all want the best bang for_
_our buck?_
