I'm a self-taught sofware engineer who started hacking away on his parents' old
computer back when Perl, CSS2 and XHTML were all the rage.

## Interests
I have a weak spot for the mathematical side of computer science
(category theory, type theory, machine learning). 
I'm partial to functionally oriented languages, be they of the Lisp-y 
(Clojure/ClojureScript)) or ML-y (Haskell, Purescript) variety.

I've spent ten years of my life studying/doing physics, so if you ever want to talk 
(or hear me evangelize) about quantum gravity, emergent spacetime or many-worlds
quantum mechanics, hit me up!

Aside from software and physics, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, runner
and all-out outdoors enthousiast. I feel strongly about veganism and 
more ethical approaches to food (though in a very non-militant way!).
I like books. 

I keep an [index of lecture series](/lectures) that had a significant impact on me, and would
recommend to anyone.
