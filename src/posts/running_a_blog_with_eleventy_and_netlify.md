  ```python
    def fib(n):
      if n == 0:
        return 0
      elif n == 1:
        return 1
      else:
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Inline mathematics seems to work pretty well: $E = mc^2$. I wonder how display
mode maths looks. 
$$ \oint_\gamma f(z)d\,z = 2\pi i\, \mathrm{Res}(\gamma)_{}$$.
