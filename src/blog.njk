  Consider this a little space to put the
  thoughts and musings that I've written, or have yet to write.
  From a more technical side, it'll also serve as a place for me to take notes as
  I learn new technologies in the ever-evolving tech world. Most tinkerers and
  perpetual learners will agree: aside from the official documentation, 
  personal notes of people describing how they solved problems or configured tools 
  are the single most useful source of information when grappling with new technologies.

  Let this, then, be my tiny contribution to the edifice that is the grand sum of
  personal technical blogs.
