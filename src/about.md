I'm a self-taught sofware engineer who started hacking away on his parents' old
computer back when Perl, CSS2 and XHTML were all the rage.

[Here's a list](https://www.samroelants.com/projects) of things I've gotten 
up to recently.

## Interests
I have a weak spot for the mathematical side of computer science
(category theory, type theory, machine learning). 
I'm partial to functionally oriented languages, be they of the Lisp-y 
(Clojure/ClojureScript)) or ML-y (Haskell, Purescript) variety.

I've spent ten years of my life studying/doing physics, so if you ever want to talk 
(or hear me evangelize) about quantum gravity, emergent spacetime or many-worlds
quantum mechanics, hit me up!

Aside from software and physics, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, runner
and all-out outdoors enthousiast. I feel strongly about veganism and 
more ethical approaches to food (though in a very non-militant way!).
I like books. 

## Currently
Currently reading:
- [Tonal Harmony, with an introduction to twentieth-century music](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168322.Tonal_Harmony_with_an_Introduction_to_Twentieth_Century_Music?from_search=true) - *Kostka
    & Payne*
- [Clojure Programming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10883803-clojure-programming?from_search=true) - *Chas Emerick*

Currently playing:
- [Mikrokosmos II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K44mcMjH2GE) - *Bela Bartok*
- [Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRyE7kN0rlk) - *Johann Sebastian Bach*

    If I had three wishes, I would wish for:
    <ol>
      <li> Enough money to stay enrolled at my alma mater for life and spend my
        life studying.</li>
      <li> The ability to play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QH8MstNkKg" target="_blank">Chopin Ballades</a>. Currently working my way 
        through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRyE7kN0rlk">Anna-Magdalena Bach Notebook</a>. But someday...</li>
      <li>World peace, of course.</li>
