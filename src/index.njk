    <h1>About me </h1>
    I enjoy finding elegant, efficient and robust solutions to tough problems, 
    because, while all solutions are equal, some are more equal than others.
    An extensive training in mathematical physics has developed my skills
    in reasoning, abstraction and well though-out design. 
    While my experience lies mainly
    in numerical simulations in Python, Julia and Fortran, I am passionate 
    about web technologies and functional programming.

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>
      I have a weak spot for the mathematical side of computer science
      (category theory, type theory).
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from software, I am an avid climber, mountaineer, runner
      and all-out outdoors enthousiast. I feel strongly about veganism and 
      more ethical approaches to food. I like books.

    <strong>Books:</strong> Learn you a Haskell for great good <em>(Lipovaca)</em>, Real World Haskell <em>(O'Sullivan, Goerzen, Stewart)</em>,
    An introduction to Category Theory <em>(Simmons)</em>
