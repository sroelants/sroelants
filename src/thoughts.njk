  <h1> Thoughts</h1>
  <p>
  Consider this a little space to put the
  thoughts and musings that I've written, or have yet to write.
  From a more technical side, it'll also serve as a place for me to take notes as
  I learn new technologies in the ever-evolving tech world. Most tinkerers and
  perpetual learners will agree: aside from the official documentation, 
  personal notes of people describing how they solved problems or configured tools 
  are the single most useful source of information when grappling with new technologies.

  <p>
  Let this, then, be my tiny contribution to the edifice that is the grand sum of
  personal technical blogs.
